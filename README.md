# DragonBot-Discord

I used this bot to learn the basics from python. Now I started working on a reworked version (To have clean code and a specific goal)
That's why I'm putting this version on GitHub since I won't be using this any time soon.
It might also help out people trying to create a bot and not knowing how to do certain things, but the code might not be as "clean" as you'd like.

Anyways, if you need any help send me a message on Telegram or Discord (Can be found here [my site :p](https://liamd.me)

### Some things I wouldn't copy

- If you want to copy any of the sql please make it a function and don't do it like I did and place it in each function you use it.
- Ofcourse I didn't add the database *Totally not because it became corrupter or anything*. This means you should make it yourself and add the queries yourself.
